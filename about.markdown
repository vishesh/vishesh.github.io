I'm Vishesh Yadav, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area. I
currently work for Apple, on FoundationDB a distributed key-value store.
Opinions are my own.

### Interests

My interests are quite broad, and I like to explore various domains in computer
science. The ones I stuck with the longest are **distributed systems**,
**programming language design**, and **compilers**. Keeping up with the *trend*,
I sometimes play around with **machine learning** as well.

**On Distributed Systems**

Most of my experience is on distributed systems, working on software systems
that can scale for millions of users.

**On Programming Languages, Type Systems and Software Engineering**

On my own time, I like to explore the world the programming language design,
type systems and compilers. I tend to prefer languages that have a strong and
expressive type-system, and can run fast. I also enjoy dynamically typed
languages. I particularly enjoy programming in Racket, mainly because of its
insanely powerful macros and gradual type-system.

### Current Projects

I push code [on Github](https://github.com/vishesh). Here's a list of projects
I'm currently working on:

- [RacketScript](https://github.com/racketscript/racketscript): an (experimental)
  [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) to JavaScript compiler.
- [FoundationDB](https://github.com/apple/foundationdb): a strict-serializable
   distributed database.
